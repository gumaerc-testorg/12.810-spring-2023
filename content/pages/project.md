## General Information

Project topics should be decided at midterm. Students can select one of the suggested topics below or come up with a topic themselves in consultation with the instructor. The project can be either original or a review. Project presentations took place in the last week of class. Students had 12 minutes for the presentation and 3 minutes for questions.

## Suggested Project Topics

1. Super-rotation (theory and observations) 
2. The Hadley cells in past climates or on other planets
3. More advanced theories of the Hadley cells 
4. Parameterization of gravity wave drag in weather and climate models 
5. Dynamics of monsoons 
6. PV-theta view of atmospheric dynamics, including the influence of diabatic heating 
7. Dynamics of the annular modes 
8. Dynamics of blocking 
9. Macroturbulence of Earth’s atmosphere 
10. Angular momentum balance (imbalance?) of Earth’s atmosphere 
11. Response of the jet stream / storm tracks to climate change 
12. Atmospheric dynamics on a high-obliquity planet 
13. Diabatic Rossby vortices (extratropical storms in which latent heating plays a major role)
14. Gravity wave generation (and propagation) from wind farms

## Project Grading

The written report and class presentation are each worth 20% of the grade for the course.
